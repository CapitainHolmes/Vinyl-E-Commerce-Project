# VINYL E-COMMERCE APP - MILSTONE PROJECT 4
 
#### Full Stack Frameworks With Djagno Project

In this project, we were asked to build a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset, setting 
up an authentication mechanism and providing paid access to the site's data and/or other activities based on the dataset, such as the purchase of a product/service.

We were given three example ideas which we could choose from, which were:

- Project Example Idea 1 - Build an issue tracker
    - External user’s goal: Report and track work on bugs and other issues with a product they like.
    - Site owner's goal: Get user's feedback to guide prioritisation and get money to fund work on future features.

- Project Example Idea 2 - Build an auction place to sell historical artifacts
    - External user’s goal: Find, learn about and acquire artifacts they are interested in.
    - Site owner's goal: Earn money on selling the artifacts (the site owner is the seller).

- Project Example Idea 2 - Build a site to sell your graphic design services.
    - External user’s goal: Users are able to purchase graphical designs to address their needs.
    - Site owner's goal: Earn money for doing freelance design work.

For this project I decided to use ideas from both Example Ideas 2 and 3 and create an E-Commerce Appliation that makes money through selling new/used and rare/limited edition
vinyl records.

## UX DESIGN

This application will give the User the ability to browse through all avaliable Vinyls for sale, check the price for each item, see the rarity and/or check to see
whether or not they're limited edition. The User will also be able to search for a specific vinyl by name (if that item is on the app and for sale), 
show and group all avaliable rare/limited edition vinyls in a search and also search for a specific music genre.
